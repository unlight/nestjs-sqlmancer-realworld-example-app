# Work In Progress

# RealWorld Example App

> ### TypeGraphQL & Sqlmancer codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo]()

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **TypeGraphQL & Sqlmancer** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **TypeGraphQL & Sqlmancer** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

## Getting started

```sh
npm ci
npm start:dev
```

## How it works

Application is written using TypeGraphQL & Sqlmancer...

### Project Structure

-   `src` - Main application source code

## Resources

-   [Backend API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api)
